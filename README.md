MATLAB Code for Matrix Density Adjustment

Description:

This MATLAB code provides a versatile tool for adjusting the density of an arbitrary matrix. It accepts a matrix A and a desired density value and returns a new matrix B with the specified density. The code employs a flexible approach that either prunes smaller elements to reduce density or adds small elements to increase density, ensuring the desired target is achieved.

Features:

1-Arbitrary Matrix Input: Accommodates matrices of any size and density.

2-Desired Density Specification: Allows users to set the target density.

3-Adaptive Adjustment: Employs pruning or addition strategies based on the current density and desired target.

4-Efficiency: Strives to optimize the adjustment process for efficient execution.
